# SchoolStandardisedTestAnalysis
Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks to analyse standardised test in district wide schools. 
The outcome will show results of a high level snapshot of the entire district and of each school based on key metrics. 
It will also show top 5 best and worst schools based on the overall passing rate. 
There are also break downs of key metrics. 

# Two Observable trends based on the date
  1. Given the provided data, we can conclude that the students in charter type school have a much higher passing rate overall and scored better in both Math and Reading tests than the district school.
  2. Students seem to be better at reading than maths as reading tests have higher passing rate.
